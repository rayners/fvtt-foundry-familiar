A simple FoundryVTT module that integrates a large language model (LLM) into the game interface, providing a "magical familiar" that can answer questions, summarize content, and assist GMs with campaign management through AI.

## üìö Documentation

Full documentation will be available at: **[docs.rayners.dev/familiar](https://docs.rayners.dev/familiar)** (coming soon)

## About

Foundry Familiar adds an AI-powered assistant directly into your FoundryVTT interface. The familiar can read your journal entries, answer questions about your campaign, and provide contextual assistance to game masters. It uses OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, making it compatible with local AI models like Ollama as well as cloud services.

## Development Status

This module is in the very early stages of alpha development with minimal testing.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Limitations

- **Only tested with**: Ollama + qwen3 model
- **Untested**: OpenAI, custom endpoints, other models
- **Compatibility**: Limited verification across different setups

### Current Implementation Status

- [x] Core LLM integration with Ollama/qwen3
- [x] Basic settings configuration dialog
- [x] Simple journal access and summarization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across AI services
- [ ] OpenAI/cloud service verification
- [ ] Multi-model compatibility testing
- [ ] Advanced tool system
- [ ] UI/UX polish and error handling
- [ ] Production-ready stability

Development is tracked privately but bug reports are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rayners/fvtt-familiar/issues).

## Features

### ‚úÖ Currently Implemented (Limited Testing)

- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI-compatible API support (tested with Ollama/qwen3 only)
