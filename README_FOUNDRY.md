## üîß Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Connection failed" error

- **Check**: Is your AI service running? (For Ollama, check if it's started)
- **Verify**: Are the endpoint URL and model name correct?
- **Test**: Try the built-in connection test in settings

**Problem**: "Model not found" error

- **Ollama**: Run `ollama pull qwen3` to download the tested model
- **OpenAI**: Untested - functionality not verified

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Responses are slow

- **Local AI**: This is normal - local models are slower but private
- **Cloud AI**: Check your internet connection
- **Large Responses**: Reduce the "Max Tokens" setting

**Problem**: AI responses seem off-topic

- **Solution**: Adjust the system prompt to be more specific
- **Tips**: Include context like "You are assisting with a D&D campaign"
